# CNN Image Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project involves building and training a CNN model for image classification using a custom or EuroSAT dataset, featuring at least three classes.

## Requirements

* Data preparation involves selecting and analyzing the dataset, splitting it into training, validation, and test sets, and applying augmentation and normalization techniques. The model architecture should include multiple convolutional and pooling layers, dropout layers, and L2 regularization.

* Testing and optimization will involve experimenting with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and epoch counts. Model evaluation will assess test set performance and visualize results through a confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics.

* A brief results summary should highlight key findings and insights.
